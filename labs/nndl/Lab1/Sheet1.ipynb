Avoid to generate too large cells: If a cell contains more content than which fits on a normal DIN A4 page, the content will be cut during  printing. A solution to this is to split up the cell into several smaller cells."

    "There are 4 basic elements of biological neuron in a neural network.\n",
    "\n",
<<<<<<< Updated upstream
    "The basic elements are:\n"
=======
    "1. **Cell body with nucleus (Soma)** : Neurons, like other cells, have cell body (call the **Soma**). The nucleus of the neuron found in the soma. Neurons need a lot of protein, and most neuronal proteins are synthesized in the soma as well. Various processes extend from the cell body. These include many short, branching processes know as Dendrites, a separate process that is typically larger than dendrites, known as the axon.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Dendrites/ Denritic tree**: The first two neuronal functions,receiveing and processing incoming informations, generally take place in the dendrites and cell body. Incoming signal can be either *exicitatory* - which means they tend to make the neuron fire (generate and electric pulse) - or *inhibitory* - which means that they tend to keep the neurons from firing.\n",
    "\n",
    "  Most neurons recieve many input signal throughout their dendritic trees. A single neuron may have more than one set of dendrites, and may receive many thousands of input signals. Whether or not a neuron is excited into firing an impulse depends on sum of all *exitatory* and *inhibitory* signals it receives. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. **One Axon with myelin sheath:** Axon arises from the cell body at a specialized area called the axion hillock. Many axons are covered with special insulating substance called *myelin*, which helps them convey the nerve impulse rapidly. Towarads its end, the axon splits up into many branches and develops bulbous swellings known as *axon terminals*(nerve terminals). These terminals make connection with target cells.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Synapses**: Neoron-to-Neuron connections are made onto the dendrites and cell body of other neurons. These connections are called **Synapses**. The first neuron from which the informations are carried called **presynaptic neuron** and the target neurons are called **postsynaptic neuron**. At most synapses and junctions, information is transmitted in the form of chemical messangers called **neurotransmitters**. A single neuron may receive inputs from many presynaptic neurons, it may also make synaptic connections on numerous postsynaptic neurons via different axon terminals.\n"
