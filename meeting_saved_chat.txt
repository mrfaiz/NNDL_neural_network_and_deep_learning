10:13:13	 From Robin Mithoff : Q: The Exercises start today? Is there going to be a seperate link for it later?
10:15:32	 From Robin Mithoff : yes
10:15:34	 From TobiL : q: Is there a recommended size of lab Groups?
10:16:31	 From Wasif Islam : Is there any communication way to contact with other members to make a group?
10:17:08	 From Steffen : i cant see the other member in my team
10:17:28	 From Robin Mithoff : Q: Is it ok to record my screen for the exercise today? b/c I might have to leave for 30 minutes later (only today).
10:18:12	 From Robin Mithoff : I'll do. Thanks!:)
10:19:45	 From Robin Mithoff : There is a new one from O'Reilly with TF 2.0 for 50 bucks.
11:08:55	 From Robin Mithoff : Sorry for the off topic question: Is this zoom session going to stay open and rolls over to the exercise or do we need to open the link again short before the exercise starts?
11:09:09	 From Robin Mithoff : thx
11:09:21	 From Jan : another off topic Question
11:09:38	 From Jan : you said we can do Group findings in the Announcements forum
11:09:44	 From Jan : but I don't see any way to write in there
11:09:56	 From Jan : sure
11:33:08	 From Nikita Smirnov : Q: back to deep learning, is there any class of input data, on which deep learning models show now more failure then classical pattern recognition? Or in any case deep laerning is better?
11:33:19	 From ASHOK VAISHNAV : We have only one lecture and exercise a week? 
11:33:44	 From Benjamin Müller : Q: Another organizational issue: Here are some students from Data Science from the FH Kiel. As far as I have heard, we should come forward, because this course is not part of our regular degree program.
11:34:12	 From Carsten Meyer : yes, there is one lecture and one lab per week
11:34:18	 From Lars Schmarje : @Nikita: Deep Learning is highly data depended if you have few data Deep learning algorithm are not so good
11:39:47	 From Nikita Smirnov : @Lars: interesting is: what makes the input data more likely to be successfully classified while using deep learning algorithms and in what situations we are still needed to manually estimate feature vector / decision rules? Or maybe it is a huge question, which couldn't be briefly answered and there are lots of things you need to take into account in order to say this definitely?
11:44:22	 From Lars Schmarje : @Ashok: yes there is only one lab and lecture each week
11:46:06	 From Benjamin Müller : @Nikita: Just think of it as a linear optimization. In Neural networks there are a lot of variables to be estimated, so you need a lot of data. If there are more variables (in NN: learning weights) than data (rows) for example, you have a real problem.
11:47:06	 From Lars Schmarje : Actually almost Always you have more weights than data
11:50:08	 From jakobmeggendorfer : Is it possible to record the lecture? I’m asking because unfortunately I have another lecture at the same time.
11:52:32	 From Serafim Simonov : If i don't mix it up, I think he said in the begining that you are allowed to do it for personal usage. 
11:56:42	 From Moufdi T'aha : I missed the first cours due to some tecnique issues can you please tell me in which slide you stopped ?
11:56:53	 From HoangNguyen : anyone here can access to the OLAT?
11:57:06	 From Lars Schmarje : not really
11:57:10	 From Steffen : no it is down
11:57:20	 From Gresa Nuredini : no, not at all
11:57:34	 From Nikita Smirnov : It is still impossible even to see the members of your group, not to speak about communicating with them. Or maybe only I have that issue?
11:57:36	 From Moufdi T'aha : thanks
11:58:15	 From Steffen : i have the same problem
11:58:20	 From Cedric Ziemann : same here
11:59:36	 From Nikita Smirnov : We may try ilearn - there it is fully possible
12:00:08	 From Al Amin : would slack be viable solution?
12:00:37	 From adnan addy : we can create workspace in slack
12:02:11	 From Steffen : can we take picture of our writen solution or do we have to make everything in latex?
12:02:24	 From Ravish : I have mistakenly enrolled in Team 23 can i change it? i
12:03:36	 From Lars Schmarje : @Ravish: I just activated that you can unroll, check if it is now working
12:04:35	 From Elvin Garibzade : Students from Team-3 send me an email : stu217344@mail.uni-kiel.de
12:10:44	 From Timo Glas : Q: How can FH Students access the CAU gitlab system...I've an Olat account but cannot login to gitlab of CAU...?
12:10:59	 From Lars Schmarje : @ Timo:
12:11:25	 From Lars Schmarje : See the pdf sheet the System Access is only allowed via a Special deploy token
12:11:41	 From Lars Schmarje : Anyone with this token has read access
12:11:46	 From Timo Glas : thx
12:12:59	 From Hannah : Q: Can we also answer the excercises in german?
12:13:09	 From Lars Schmarje : @Hannah:
12:13:11	 From Lars Schmarje : yes
12:14:16	 From Lars Schmarje : if all Team members are german natives, else you have to use english in order to not exclude the internation Team member
12:18:23	 From C. Maedge : Q: Another organizational issue: Here are some students from Data Science from the FH Kiel. As far as I have heard, we should come forward, because this course is not part of our regular degree program.
12:19:08	 From TobiL : So Google Colab for working remotely in Teamsand jupyter Notebook for locally opening the Sheets and executing further python code?
12:19:27	 From C. Maedge : I don´t have an OLAT account yet.
12:21:05	 From TobiL : Ahhh! Now I get it. Thank you
12:21:27	 From Richard Hanß : What would be so hard about installing tensorflow locally? Is it related to using the gpu?
12:24:55	 From Moufdi T'aha : is there any gpu constraints to work the labsheets properly ? 
12:25:14	 From Christoph Fricke : Would it be possible to bundle everything in a docker container for people who know docker? It looks like there are already a few containers...
12:25:27	 From Lars Schmarje : What do you mean with gpu constraints
12:26:13	 From Lars Schmarje : @Fricke: the issue is you still Need an enviroment to execute the docker Image with powerful GPU in the background
12:26:30	 From Lars Schmarje : @Fricke: We cant provide this for every student
12:26:43	 From Steffen : student in lab team 06 can you send me a mail to stu126108@mail.uni-kiel.de
12:26:52	 From Carsten Meyer : git clone https://gitlab+deploy-token-26:XBza882znMmexaQSpjad@git.informatik.uni-kiel.de/las/nndl.git <your target directory>
12:30:10	 From jakobmeggendorfer : Can my team partner in lab team 08 please write me a mail? stu217268@mail.uni-kiel.de
12:30:18	 From C. Maedge : We don´t see the exercise sheet at the moment
12:30:43	 From Lars Schmarje : @Maedge: we cant upload it at the moment
12:31:19	 From C. Maedge : I understood that. But Mr Meyer wanted to share his Screen and Show the exercises here. It was just a remark.
12:31:40	 From C. Maedge : now we see it
12:32:04	 From Elvin Garibzade : yes please, Forum is good idea.
12:32:14	 From C. Maedge : could you Show ex 4 completely for a Moment, please?
12:34:14	 From Jan : should we answer to the post on the Forum or make our own?
12:34:27	 From C. Maedge : thx
12:34:28	 From Lars Schmarje : @Jan What works better for you
12:36:23	 From Richard Hanß : May we leave the conference now if we don't plan on starting the exercise right away and don't have any remaining questions?
